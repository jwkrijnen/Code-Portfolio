# Code-Portfolio
Examples of code written for university projects to show prospective employers.
The files have generic names so that they are unlikely to be found by current students working on similar projects.
Some files may include comments or variable names that refer to information from textbooks or lecture notes and therefore may not make sense out of context.

python_example1 file is an example of python code used to implement the Gift Wrapping Algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points. It evaluates the time it takes for the algorithm to complete over a range of points of different distributions.

python_example2 file is an example of python code used to implement the Graham Scan Algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points. It evaluates the time it takes for the algorithm to complete over a range of points of different distributions.

c++_example file is an example of C++ code and use of the OpenGL 2.0 framework to create an 3d alien hangar environment for a Computer Graphics assignment
