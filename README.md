# Code-Portfolio
Examples of code written for university projects to show prospective employers.
The files have generic names so that they are unlikely to be found by current university students working on similar projects.
Some files may include comments or variable names that refer to information from textbooks or lecture notes and therefore may not make sense out of context.

c++_example is an example of C++ code and use of the OpenGL 2.0 framework to create an 3d alien hangar environment for a Computer Graphics assignment

python_example1 is a python implementation of the Gift Wrapping Algorithm, used for finding the convex hull of a set of points. It evaluates the time it takes for the algorithm to find a solution over a range of points of different distributions.

python_example2 is a python implementation of the RIPv2 routing protocol. It isn't an elegant solution and doesn't include proper commenting, but has a wide variety of code being used. The program was written as part of a group project with one other person.

python_example3 is an auxiliary file to the previous file. 

c_example is part of a c program that allowed two people to play a game of papers scissors rock against each other using a small embedded system with buttons and a navswitch. The program was written as part of a group project with one other person.
